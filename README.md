### Player Findr
Player Findr is single page application built with Vanilla Javascript that integrates the OpecCage API and Leaflet Maps library to help team sports players find players close to them.

### Motivation
How many times did you need one last person for a 5 on 5 basketball game? or two more players for a full soccer game? Player Findr was built to allow people to find extra sports players and play a game of their choosing.
